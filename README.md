* Title: How do surfaces grow?
* Abstract: How do surfaces grow, and why do so many look statistically alike?
  This talk connects intuitive simulations with modern probability to explore
  surface growth and universality. We begin with a CLT refresher as a baseline
  for randomness, then show why it fails for growing interfaces: local
  interactions and spatial-temporal dependencies break independence. Using
  Tetris-like ballistic deposition (sticky and non-sticky) as model systems, we
  compare simulated interfaces and empirical fluctuation scaling, and discuss
  their relation to the KPZ universality class. We then highlight experimental
  evidence from thin-film growth where universal scaling emerges in real
  materials. Along the way, we emphasize what "universality" means, how scaling
  exponents organize phenomena, and where open questions remainâ€”such as
  identifying non-KPZ behaviors. The goal is a concrete, visual understanding of
  stochastic growth, bridging simulations, data, and theory.  

## Setup With uv

- Install uv:
  - macOS (brew): `brew install uv`
  - Linux/macOS (script): `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows (scoop): `scoop install uv`
- Create local venv: `uv venv -p 3.11`
- Install deps: `uv sync`
- Verify Manim: `uv run python -c "import manim; print(manim.__version__)"`

### System Dependencies

- FFmpeg (required for Manim video rendering):
  - macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
  - Windows: Install FFmpeg and add it to PATH.
- LaTeX (optional, for TeX text in scenes): TeX Live or MiKTeX.

## Common Commands

- Serve slides: `uv run -s serve` then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html`.
- Render LIS animation (after scene is added): `uv run -s render_lis`.
- Manual serve alternative: `uv run python -m http.server 8000`.

## Notes

- See `AGENTS.md` for repository guidelines (structure, testing, media, and docs).
- Manim render outputs to `media/`; final videos should live under `videos/` and be referenced by slides using relative paths.

## Rendering Animations with Make

A `Makefile` is provided to simplify the rendering of Manim animations. From the project root, you can use the following commands:

- `make all`: Renders both the original and the Gemini-generated LIS animations.
- `make lis`: Renders only the original LIS animation.
- `make lis-gemini`: Renders only the Gemini-generated LIS animation.
- `make clean`: Removes the `media/` directory created by Manim.

The `Makefile` handles the creation of the `videos/` directory and copies the rendered animations to the correct location.
