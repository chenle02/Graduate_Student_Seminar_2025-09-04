# Animation for the corresponding relation of LIS with percolation model.

* Use manim
* Set N = 8.
* Generate a random permutation of [1, 2, ..., N].
* Show the permutation as a set of points in an N x N grid.
* Show the longest increasing subsequence by highlighting the corresponding points with salient color and gray out the rest.
* Show a path from (1, 1) to (N, N) that only goes right or up and passes through the highlighted points. 
* Show the percolation model by coloring the grid cells that are above and to the right of each highlighted point.
