# Longest increasing subsequence
*  Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence)
* Example 

In the first 16 terms of the binary Van der Corput sequence

    0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15

one of the longest increasing subsequences is

    0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.

This subsequence has length six; the input sequence has no seven-member increasing subsequences. The longest increasing subsequence in this example is not the only solution: for instance,

    0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15
    0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15
    0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15

are other increasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.
