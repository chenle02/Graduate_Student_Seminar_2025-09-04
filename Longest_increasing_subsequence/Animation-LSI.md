# Another animation of Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
* Input: N and M
* Produce M permutations of size N (0 to N-1). One at each row.
* For each permutation, find the LIS using dynamic programming,  only highlighting the increasing subsequence.
* At the right of each random permutation sequence, show the length of the LIS.
